## Working with Doctrine Migrations
    
### Using the integration of your framework

  * symfony 2 [doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle](https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle)
  * ZF2 [doctrine/doctrine-orm-module](https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/doctrine-orm-module) 
  * laravel [mitchellvanw/laravel-doctrine](https://packagist.org/packages/mitchellvanw/laravel-doctrine)
  * Silex [kurl/silex-doctrine-migrations-provider](https://packagist.org/packages/kurl/silex-doctrine-migrations-provider)
  * nette [zenify/doctrine-migrations](https://packagist.org/packages/zenify/doctrine-migrations)
  * others...
        
### Using composer
            
```composer require doctrine/migrations```
        
### Downloading the latest phar release

You can download the [doctrine migrations phar](https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/releases) directly on the release page

### Building Your own Phar

Make sure Composer and all necessary dependencies are installed:

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install --dev
```

Make sure that the Box project is installed:

```bash
curl -s http://box-project.org/installer.php | php
```

Build the PHAR archive:

```bash
php box.phar build
```

The `doctrine-migrations.phar` archive is built in the `build` directory.

#### Creating archive disabled by INI setting

If you receive an error that looks like:

    creating archive "build/doctrine-migrations.phar" disabled by INI setting

This can be fixed by setting the following in your php.ini:

```ini
; http://php.net/phar.readonly
phar.readonly = Off
```

## Installing Dependencies

To install dependencies run a composer update:

```composer update```

## symfony 2.3 users

Doctrine migration need the doctrine/orm 2.4, you need to [update your composer.json](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/blob/v2.3.28/composer.json#L12) to the last version of it for symfony 2.3.

That version is compatible with the doctrine/orm 2.4 and there are [very little upgrade needed](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-24).

## Running the unit tests

To run the tests, you need the sqlite extension for php.
On Unix-like systems, install:
- php5-sqlite

On Windows, enable the extension by uncommenting the following lines in php.ini
```
extension = php_pdo_sqlite.dll
extension = php_sqlite3.dll
extension_dir = ext
```

Running the tests from the project root:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

On Windows run phpunit from the full path
```
php vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit
```
This appears to be some bug.

Happy testing :-)
